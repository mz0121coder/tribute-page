    <p id="tribute-info">Arguably the most important architect of the contemporary era, Frank Gehry's unique style is hard to categorize. Although his earlier work is rooted in
      modernism, his later designs have consciously rejected modernist tropes. Experimenting with a range of materials
      from cheap mass-produced items to space-age titanium, his buildings are entertaining and surprising, but also
      functional. Gehry has designed a number of iconic buildings including the Bilbao Guggenheim, the Walt Disney
      Concert Hall, and the Biomuseo in Panama City and these have become world-renowned attractions in their own right,
      often bringing tourists and money into an area. His style continues to evolve to the present day and he is still
      active in architectural design, creating bold testaments to his own innovative vision.</p>
